These scripts were written for my work at GFZ Potsdam. I do not recommend to
use or install them. Feel free to copy&paste some lines.

I refactored the rf functionality in a separate repository.
There are a lot of alternatives for Python packages supporting
ambient noise cross-correlation.

Required:
- python 2.7
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- basemap
- ipython
- obspy
- seispy
- progressbar

sito consist of the following major modules:
data - Class for data handling (You can set up your own data calss here)
events - Class for handling event data (better: use new Catalog class in ObsPy)
imaging - Customized plotting
map - Customized station map plotting
noisexcorr - correlation of noise
rf - Receiver function calculation
station - Class for handling station data
stream - Class derived from obspy.trace.Stream with custom methods
trace - Class derived from obspy.trace.Trace with custom methods
util - Utilities like deconvolution, polarisation, rotation, pspier
       (mainly imported from other projects)
xcorr - Cross correlation functions

minor modules:
noise_migration - migrate noise phases in correlations backwards (experimental)

tiny modules:
debug - ipython debugging functionality
seismometer - PAZ of STS-2 and Wood-Anderson
